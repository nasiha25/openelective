## Some Title

KI-CAD (Kicad) is a free, open-source software suite used for electronic design automation (EDA). It allows users to create schematics and design printed circuit boards (PCBs) with professional-grade tools. Popular among hobbyists, students, and professionals, Kicad supports multi-layer boards, custom component creation, and integrates with 3D viewers for visualizing the final product. Its active community and continuous development make it a powerful alternative to commercial EDA tools.
